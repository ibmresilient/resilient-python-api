**2024-12: version 51.0.4.0**
* Updated STOMP package version

**2024-07: version 51.0.2.2**
* Update dependency version of setuptools version to 70.3.x to address CVE-2024-6345

**2024-07: version 51.0.2.1**

* All IBM SOAR Python libraries now only officially support Python 3.9, 3.11, and 3.12. To continue using
  SOAR libraries on earlier versions of Python, use v52.0.2.0.974
* Replace underlying stomp library (previously ``stompest``) with modern library ``stomp.py``
* Remove stomp configuration option ``stomp_params``. This is no longer supported with the new ``stomp.py`` library
* Fix for secret substitution when value starts with "^" but is not intended to be substituted

**2024-05: version 51.0.2.0**

* Added official support for Python 3.12
* There is a known issue with running ``resilient-circuits`` as a service on Windows in Python 3.12. This is not a
  problem with ``resilient-circuits``, however, the development team will continue to monitor this for a time when
  Windows does support Python 3.12 services. Until then, please use Python 3.11 or 3.9 on Windows for integration servers

**2024-04: version 51.0.1.1**

* Updated selftest to better handle connection issues when running in App Host
* Modified ``stomp_prefetch_limit`` configuration option to default to the same value as ``num_workers``.
  The prefetch limit can still be manually adjusted by changing ``stomp_prefetch_limit`` in the ``[resilient]``
  section of app.config if you desire the prefetch and workers to have different values
* Inbound app decorator now expects headers as the second parameter for the decorated function. This is intended
  for better debugging with more inbound message information passed to the handler

**2024-02: version 51.0.1.0**

* All SOAR Python libraries now officially support Python 3.11
* Selftest now outputs ``pip`` environment details to better debug failing tests by quickly seeing the dependency versions
* ``resilient_circuits.rest_helper.get_resilient_client`` now uses a cache rather than a global variable to store
  previously fetched clients. This is an improvement for threaded applications using this logic to store multiple
  client objects for different instances

**2023-11: version 51.0.0.0**

* Added support for new SOAR v.r.m.f version scheme. If running an app on ``resilient-circuits<51.0.0.0``,
  the incorrect version of the SOAR server may be displayed if connecting to a SOAR server with
  version greater than or equal to 51.x. Please consider upgrading ``resilient-circuits`` to the
  latest version as soon as you can. A gentle reminder that SOAR python libraries versioning
  is independent of SOAR server versions and any version of circuits works with any version of SOAR
  (i.e. ``resilient-circuits==v51.0.0.0`` will work fine with SOAR v48.0.0). It is always recommended
  that you use the latest version of all SOAR Python Libraries
* Removed obfuscation of "id" in logs and made general improvements of log obfuscation to better
  target sensitive information while leaving important information in the logs

**2023-10: version 50.1**

* Allow for ``.`` character in message queue names and improved logging around queues not found on startup
* Merged external `PR <https://github.com/ibmresilient/resilient-python-api/pull/27>`_ to improve
  support for multiple circuits services running in Windows

**2023-08: version 50.0**

* Added support for app secrets in function inputs. Use the syntax similar to using app secrets in app.config
  by referencing app secrets in text within a function input. Example:

  .. code-block::

      inputs.fn_my_fn_input_1 = "$SECRET_FROM_APP_HOST_PROTECTED_SECRETS"
      inputs.fn_my_fn_input_2 = "Here we can insert our ${SECRET_FROM_APP_HOST} in the middle of the string"
      inputs.fn_my_fn_input_3 = "^SECRET_FROM_PAM"


**2023-07: version 49.1**

* No major changes. Just bumping build number to coincide with other builds

**2023-05: version 49.0**

* Improved logging on restarts
* Improved obfuscation of sensitive information from app.config in logs
* Added ability to disable persistent sessions for ``resilient-lib.RequestsCommon`` in app functions using new optional ``rc_use_persistent_sessions`` configuration parameter
* Added ``resilient-app-config-plugins`` as a new package to manage third party credentials within SOAR apps

**2023-04: version 48.1**

* Better log handling for errors upon restart
* Added new configs for log rotation. ``log_max_bytes`` sets the maximum bytes per log file; defaults to ``10000000``.
  ``log_backup_count`` sets the maximum number of log files to keep as backups while files rotate; defaults to ``10``
* Improved log filtering for sensitive values

**2023-02: version 48.0**

* Include ``threadName`` in the app logs
* Display SOAR server version in startup logs. Note: for CP4S this displays the underlying SOAR version, not the platform version
* Updated project to use ``pyproject.toml`` and ``setup.cfg`` metadata files. Build backend continues to use ``setuptools``.
  Instead of directly invoking setup.py to get a sdist or wheel, use ``build`` as a build frontend:

  .. code-block:: bash

      pip install build
      python -m build

**2022-12: version 47.1**

* No major changes. Just bumping build number to coincide with other builds

**2022-11: version 47.0**

* Updated default ``num_workers`` value to **25** if not set and default value in template app.config file to **50**

**2022-08: version 46.0**

* The ``FunctionResult`` in an ``AppFunctionComponent`` now supports a ``custom_results`` kwarg. If set to ``True`` the
  dictionary of results sent to SOAR will be exactly as passed and not contain our default payload. We **do not recommend this**
  however in some cases it may be necessary
* Enhanced the :func:`resilient_circuits.is_this_a_selftest() <resilient_circuits.helpers.is_this_a_selftest>` method
  to check if a Component has been instantiated in a resilient-circuits instance running ``selftest``. Example:

  .. code-block::

    from resilient_circuits.helpers import is_this_a_selftest

    if is_this_a_selftest(self):
        # Do nothing...

* Added a new configuration setting to app.config, called ``heartbeat_timeout_threshold``. It is a value in seconds between the current ``HeartbeatTimeout`` event and the first ``HeartbeatTimeout`` event. If the time is greater than the ``heartbeat_timeout_threshold``, the resilient-circuits process stops.

**2022-07: version 45.1**

* Bug fix to avoid ``@app_function`` Components firing on all channels leading to Functions being invoked multiple times

**2022-05: version 45.0**

* Added new config ``trap_exception`` and if set to ``True`` a Function's exception will be ignored with the error sent as a Status Message
  and a default payload returned like below, allowing the Workflow or Playbook to continue

  .. code-block::

    {
      "success": False,
      "reason": "Error message"
    }
* Added a custom header for all requests from ``resilient-circuits`` that will include the current version of the library: ``Resilient-Circuits-Version: 45.0.0``
* Better handling of errors if an app's ``selftest`` is unimplemented

**2022-04: version 44.1**

* Move Jinja template management functions to ``resilient-lib`` while
  keeping backward compatibility here

**2022-02: version 44.0**

* Ensure ``tests/`` is not included in packaged code

* Enhancement to ``selftest`` to also check connection back to SOAR platform.
