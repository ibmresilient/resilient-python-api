**2023-11: version 51.0.0.0**

* Added optional retry to :class:`resilient_lib.RequestsCommon.execute() <resilient_lib.components.requests_common.RequestsCommon.execute>`.
  This allows developers to control the retry behavior of failed requests. See
  :class:`resilient_lib.RequestsCommon.execute() <resilient_lib.components.requests_common.RequestsCommon.execute>` for more details and examples

**2023-10: version 50.1**

* Unit test improvements to better handle flaky ``requests`` tests

**2023-08: version 50.0**

* No major changes. Just bumping build number to coincide with other builds

**2023-07: version 49.1**

* No major changes. Just bumping build number to coincide with other builds

**2023-05: version 49.0**

* Added new functions for pollers to interact with SOAR

**2023-04: version 48.1**

* Updated SOAR case default filters for poller helper methods

**2023-02: version 48.0**

* Added support for ``verify`` config in app.config when using
  :class:`resilient_lib.RequestsCommon.execute() <resilient_lib.components.requests_common.RequestsCommon.execute>`.
  ``verify`` now can be set to ``True``, ``False``, or ``<path_to_your_custom_CA_bundle>`` to control the value used
  when verifying SSL certificates. This change is backward compatible with any apps that use ``RequestsCommon.execute()``
  so any apps updated to run on v48.0 will pull in these changes and the ``verify`` configuration will be supported for that app
* Updated :class:`resilient_lib.RequestsCommon <resilient_lib.components.requests_common.RequestsCommon>` to take advantage
  of persistent sessions from the ``requests`` library using ``requests.Session()``. This has multiple advantages, 
  including cookies persisting from the endpoint and significant performance increases when connecting to the same host. 
  If non-session objects are desired, switch your code to use the new class
  :class:`resilient_lib.RequestsCommonWithoutSession <resilient_lib.components.requests_common.RequestsCommonWithoutSession>`
  which behaves the same as the old ``RequestsCommon`` would
* Updated project to use ``pyproject.toml`` and ``setup.cfg`` metadata files. Build backend continues to use ``setuptools``.
  Instead of directly invoking setup.py to get a sdist or wheel, use ``build`` as a build frontend:

  .. code-block:: bash

      pip install build
      python -m build

**2022-12: version 47.1**

* :class:`resilient_lib.RequestsCommon.get_client_auth() <resilient_lib.components.requests_common.RequestsCommon.get_client_auth>` renamed from ``get_clientauth``. Alias provided for ``get_clientauth`` for backward compatiblity. Please use :class:`get_client_auth() <resilient_lib.components.requests_common.RequestsCommon.get_client_auth>` from now on

**2022-11: version 47.0**

* Support for poller-based apps added with new `Common Poller Methods`_, 
  including ``resilient_lib.poller()`` decorator and ``resilient_lib.SOARCommon`` 
  class of common SOAR methods

  These can be specified per app in the relevant [fn_some_app] section of the app.config 
  and will be used in any requests made through ``resilient_lib.RequestsCommon``.
