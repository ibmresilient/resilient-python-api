        Get value from external provider.

        ``plain_text_value`` is the value from the app.config file. As an example,

            password=^PASS.WORD

        and ``self.options.get("password")`` is run, ``plain_text_value`` here
        will be "^PASS.WORD".

        That value should be parsed to something useable by your PAM solution's API.

        NOTE: the "^" has to be stripped out before you can use it. The recommended way to
        do that is to use ``plain_text_value.lstrip(constants.PAM_SECRET_PREFIX)``

        the protected_secrets_manager saved in the constructor.
