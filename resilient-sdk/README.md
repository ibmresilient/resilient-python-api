# IBM SOAR SDK


## Overview

The IBM SOAR SDK, formerly the IBM Resilient SDK, provides the tools and infrastructure you need to develop IBM SOAR Apps, which you can then post on our [App Exchange](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/?br=Resilient).

## Installation

To install the IBM SOAR SDK, execute the following command:

```
$ pip install resilient-sdk
```

## Usage and Documentation
For details on the commands provided with the SDK, use the `-h` option on the command line. For example, `resilient-sdk -h` and `resilient-sdk codegen -h`.

For more examples on its usage see [ibm.biz/soar-python-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-python-docs).

The IBM SOAR App Developer's Guide provides information on using the IBM SOAR SDK to develop and package apps. The guide is available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your IBM SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the App Developer's Guide by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane.
