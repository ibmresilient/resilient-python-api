**2023-12: version 51.0.0.1**
* Bug fix to support Keyring with resilient-sdk commands that use app.config to connect to SOAR.
  This has been broken since v49.0.0. Please upgrade to v51.0.0.1 to continue using SDK with Keyring.

**2023-11: version 51.0.0.0**

* Added support for new SOAR v.r.m.f version scheme. This takes effect with the release of v51.0.0.0 of
  SOAR and v51.0.0.0 of ``resilient-sdk``. To run SDK commands against SOAR v51.0.0.0 or greater,
  you must update to the latest SDK. It is important to be up to date with ``resilient-sdk`` when
  working with SOAR. You will know if you're version of the SDK is out of date by the warning message
  output when running commands. If you don't see this message you are up to date
* The ``docgen`` command now supports export files and directories of exports, including Playbooks. Use
  ``-e`` or ``--exportfile`` followed by a list of .res or .resz files or a directory with .res or .resz
  files. For example, to generate one README for a playbook export, a .res export and a directory of exports:

  .. code-block::

    $ resilient-sdk docgen -e My_Playbook.resz export.res ../Downloads/all_exports -o MyPB_export_and_all_exports.md

* Added more examples of using the SDK in the API documentation at https://ibm.biz/soar-python-docs

**2023-10: version 50.1**

* No major changes. Just bumping build number to coincide with other builds

**2023-08: version 50.0**

* The ``docgen`` command now fully supports Playbooks, including function script examples
  and extended details for each Playbook including activation conditions
* The ``codegen`` command better supports Playbooks and Subplaybooks in the markdown files created.
  Specifically, support was added for function inputs, activation conditions, and subplaybook
  details for each playbook generate. Subplaybooks are still also described in a separate markdown
  file for full details
* The ``init`` command now includes a setting to set copyright in ``.sdk_settings.json`` file.
  ``codegen`` will now automatically read this setting and set the copyright at the top of each Python file generated.
  The setting for ``copyright`` lives in the ``codegen`` section of the settings file and can be formatted
  with the current year by placing ``{0}`` in the location which you wish to include the year. Example:

  .. code-block::

      // .sdk_settings.json:
      {
        "codegen": {
            "copyright": "(c) Copyright My Inc. {0}. All Rights Reserved."
        }
      }

  with ``resilient-sdk codegen [...] --poller``, including automatically formatting the poller template file contents
  into the README file
* Updated ``validate`` markdown report to include total issue counts
* ``validate`` automatically checks the Python version of all scripts from SOAR included in your app
  ``validate`` will fail if any Playbook or Workflow scripts are written in Python 2
* Default ``apikey_permissions.txt`` file generated by ``codegen`` updated to include latest available API permissions
* ``package`` now supports blank lines in ``apikey_permissions.txt``
* Updated project to use ``pyproject.toml`` and ``setup.cfg`` metadata files. Build backend continues to use ``setuptools``.
  Instead of directly invoking setup.py to get a sdist or wheel, use ``build`` as a build frontend:

  .. code-block:: bash

      pip install build
      python -m build

**2022-12: version 47.1**

* ``clone``, ``extract``, and ``package`` commands fixed to avoid clearing out overrides for disabled Tasks in SOAR

**2022-11: version 47.0**

* Added support to ``extract`` command for sub-playbooks. They are treated like normal Playbooks so no
  further command line args are required. Just ensure you include all other customizations in your
  command. For example:

  .. code-block::

    $ resilient-sdk extract --playbook my_sub_playbook --function fn_in_sub_playbook

* ``codegen`` template updates with Python 3 syntax
* Added new ``--poller`` flag to ``codegen``. This allows for creating poller-based apps
  which generates a ``lib`` directory in the package and a ``poller`` directory each with
  items needed to create a poller-based app.

* Added support for activation fields in manually activated playbooks in the ``clone`` command

* ``codegen`` has a new argument ``--gather-results`` which will scan an ``app.log`` file to get the results for the ``output_json_example.json`` file
* When ``docgen`` is now ran, it will look for an ``output_json_example.json`` file for each function and use that for the ``README.md`` Function Output Examples
